            Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf) is a monotypic
            genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists
            of one species, Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,
            where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites.
            It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow,
            flowers.

            It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are
            opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent
            both above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring
            before the new leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1
            cm long, with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged
            samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.

            It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
